# Thought-Percentage

A simple program using the MatPlotLib Python library. 
See what you are mostly thinking about by entering a new thought whenever you want! The chart simply shows 
what percentage of your thoughts are going into a certain category. This can be a daily, weekly, or monthly tracker, as
it is all up to you to decide when you want to clear the chart and add new thoughts.
